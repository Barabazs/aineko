# Aineko

Aineko is a Python framework for building data applications.

With Aineko, you seamlessly bring data into any product and iterate quickly. Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Aineko helps you rapidly build scalable, maintainable, and fast data applications.

Under the hood, Aineko automatically configures tooling needed for production-ready data apps, like message brokers, distributed compute, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration and infrastructure.

Focus on transformations and business logic, leave the rest to Aineko.

## Main Features

### **Flexible Nodes**

* **Transformations & Business Logic** - Nodes can represent any logic that can be built in Python.
* **State Management** - Nodes can maintain internal state and share it with other nodes.
* **Connectors** - Aineko comes with pre-built nodes that serve as connectors for popular data sources and endpoints such as WebSocket and REST.

### **Powerful Datasets**

* **Streaming Data -** Datasets simplify processing of streaming data.
* **Data Broadcasting -** Share data across any node or between pipelines.
* **Policies -** Choose how to manage each dataset with granular control over settings such as data lifetime and encryption.
* **Ultra-Low Latency -** Achieve microsecond data transfer rates between nodes.
* **High Throughput -** Process billions or records per day with ease.
* **Data Testing -** Run tests on production or synthetic data without impacting live applications.

### **Convenient Pipelines**

* **Declarative -** Represent the complete topology of your system in a short YAML file.
* **Long-Living -** Pipelines remain active and process new data as soon as it is generated.
* **Cyclic Graphs -** Build use-cases that require cycles between data processing nodes.
* **Replicas -** Generate replicas of pipelines with different variables without writing new code.
